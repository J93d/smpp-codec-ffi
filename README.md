# smpp-codec-ffi

FFI bindings for the [smpp-codec](https://github.com/J93d/smpp-codec) crate, powered by [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

This crate provides high-performance, safe, and easy-to-use bindings to the `smpp-codec` library for multiple programming languages.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Seamless integration for Python, Kotlin, and Swift.
- **Full SMPP PDU Coverage**: Support for all standard SMPP PDUs (Bind, Submit, Deliver, Data, Broadcast, etc.).
- **Message Splitting**: Built-in support for splitting long messages into concatenated SMS (UDH/SAR).
- **TLV Support**: Easy handling of Optional Parameters (Tags).
- **Memory Safe**: Leverages Rust's memory safety guarantees across the FFI boundary.

## Supported Languages

- [x] **Python** (via Maturin)
- [x] **Java/Kotlin** (via UniFFI/JNA)
- [x] **Swift** (via UniFFI)

## Usage

Generated bindings and shared libraries are available in the GitHub Actions artifacts.
