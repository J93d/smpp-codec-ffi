# smpp-codec-ffi

FFI bindings for the `smpp-codec` crate, powered by [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

This crate provides a mechanism to use the `smpp-codec` library from other languages (like Python, Swift, Kotlin, etc.) by defining a UniFFI interface.

## Usage

This crate is intended to be used to generate bindings.

To generate bindings for a specific language (e.g., Python), you can use the `uniffi-bindgen` CLI tool or integrate it into your build process.

## Documentation

The API documentation is compliant with RFC 1574.
