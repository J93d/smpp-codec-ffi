# Bindings

This directory contains the generated language bindings for `smpp-codec-ffi`.

## Structure

-   **`python/`**: Python bindings (generated via `maturin` or `uniffi-bindgen`).
-   **`kotlin/`**: Kotlin bindings (generated via `uniffi-bindgen`).
-   **`swift/`**: Swift bindings (generated via `uniffi-bindgen`).

## Generation

These bindings are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow. You can also generate them locally using:

```bash
cargo run --bin uniffi-bindgen generate --library target/release/libsmpp_codec_ffi.so --language <language> --out-dir bindings/<language>
```

(Replace `<language>` with `kotlin`, `swift`, or `python` and the library path accordingly).
